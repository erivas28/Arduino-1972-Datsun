# Arduino-1972-Datsun
Autonomous Car that follows a line path, utilizing 4 DC motors. Car incorporates IR sensors to identify whether marker (black tape) is detected.
If the IR sensor detects the black tape, then the car will fix itself accordingly to stay within the constraints.
This keeps the car on path, following the black tape that is provided.
Works best where tape is clearly a different color than its background.
For testing, I pasted the black tape on white, laminated floor.  
  
  
We will also talk about different functions you may implement to the autonomous car.
This includes collision prevention, and even bluetooth controlled!
Also, creating a custom baseplate is an important step, as this allows you to
implement your own body style for the car.
